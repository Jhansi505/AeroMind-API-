### **[0:00 - 0:20] OPENING HOOK**

**VISUAL:** Drone hovering in air, 3D visualization overlay  
**AUDIO:** Ambient tech background music

**NARRATOR:**
> "What if your drone could think, understand, and execute missions on its own? What if controlling a drone was as simple as having a conversation?"

**VISUAL:** Quick cuts showing:
- Voice command being spoken
- AI processing visualization
- Drone executing complex maneuvers

**NARRATOR:**
> "Welcome to AeroMind-API — where artificial intelligence meets autonomous flight."

---

### **[0:20 - 0:50] THE PROBLEM & SOLUTION**

**VISUAL:** Split screen showing traditional drone control vs. AeroMind

**NARRATOR:**
> "Traditional drone operations are complex. They require technical expertise, manual control, and constant human supervision. But AeroMind changes everything."

**VISUAL:** Dashboard interface appearing, voice waveforms

**NARRATOR:**
> "AeroMind-API is an AI-powered agentic drone system that understands natural language, makes intelligent decisions, and executes missions autonomously. Powered by advanced language models like Gemini and Ollama, AeroMind transforms drones into intelligent assistants."

---

### **[0:50 - 1:30] CORE FEATURES DEMONSTRATION**

**VISUAL:** Terminal/Dashboard showing "Hey Leo" wake word activation

**NARRATOR:**
> "Let me show you how it works. With a simple voice command..."

**ON SCREEN TEXT:** "Hey Leo, activate and patrol the perimeter"

**VISUAL:** 
- AI agent processing the command
- 3D visualization showing planned route
- Drone executing the mission

**NARRATOR:**
> "The AI agent understands your intent, plans the optimal route, and executes the mission — all in real-time. Our advanced navigation system uses GPS utilities, path planning algorithms, and physics-based modeling to ensure safe, efficient flight."

**VISUAL:** Dashboard showing mission tools panel

**NARRATOR:**
> "AeroMind comes equipped with powerful built-in capabilities:
> - **Mission Planning** — automated route optimization
> - **Computer Vision** — real-time object detection and tracking
> - **Navigation Tools** — obstacle avoidance and waypoint management
> - **Vision Tools** — intelligent image analysis and recognition"

### **[1:30 - 2:10] REAL-WORLD APPLICATIONS**

**VISUAL:** Multi-panel showcase of use cases

#### **Panel 1: Delivery Services**
**VISUAL:** Drone carrying package, recipient verification screen

**NARRATOR:**
> "Imagine autonomous package delivery with built-in recipient verification through OTP or facial recognition."

#### **Panel 2: Security & Surveillance**
**VISUAL:** Drone performing patrol, person detection highlighting

**NARRATOR:**
> "Or intelligent security surveillance where the drone automatically detects, tracks, and monitors potential threats while alerting security personnel in real-time."

#### **Panel 3: Search & Rescue**
**VISUAL:** Drone searching terrain, thermal overlay

**NARRATOR:**
> "Search and rescue missions become faster and more efficient with AI-powered pattern recognition and autonomous navigation."
